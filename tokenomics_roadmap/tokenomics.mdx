## Tokenomics

- Seamless Gasless Onboarding  
Leverage ERC-4337 account abstraction to let users pay gas fees in $QUANT
instead of Native Gas Token eliminating the need to preload gas tokens,
reducing friction, and unlocking mass adoption

- Tiered Fee-Incentives for \$QUANT Holders  
Harmonize token utility with platform growth: holders and stakers of \$QUANT receive
escalating discounts on HypurrQuant Bot and Hypercash fees driving stickiness,
network effects, and token demand.

## Platform Architecture Overview
Our HypurrQuant Bot runs on a **multi‑AZ, private‑subnet** infrastructure to guarantee maximum security, isolation, and end‑to‑end encryption.

## Detail of Our Encryption Architecture

### 1️⃣ **Bot Server Obfuscation**

![Platform Architecture](../images/introduce/arch2.png)

• **No public ingress**: All Telegram traffic uses outbound polling via NAT Gateway.  
• **Hidden endpoint**: The bot server never exposes ports or IPs.


### 2️⃣ **Fully Isolated Service Deployment**

![Platform Architecture](../images/introduce/arch3.png)

• **AWS Private Subnets**: All services run with zero inbound internet access.  
• **Opaque networking**: Intercepted packets reveal only AWS IGW, not our servers.

> 🚫 **Attackers cannot see IPs, DNS, or ports.**


### 3️⃣ **Strict Data Access Control & No Logging Policy**

![Platform Architecture](../images/introduce/arch4.png)

• **Limited DB access**: Only Account Management and Order Servers may query user data.  
• **No sensitive logs**: No user data is ever written to disk or log streams.



### 4️⃣ **Asymmetric Encryption-Based Order Processing**

![Platform Architecture](../images/introduce/arch5.png)

• **Key storage**: Private keys encrypted with the platform’s public key.  
• **Order Server isolation**: Runs in a locked-down subnet, no open ports.  
• **Message‑driven**: Receives SQS instructions, verifies, then decrypts in‑memory only and immediately purges.

Cryptocurrencies have less data available compared to traditional financial markets, 
making it challenging to devise quant strategies. We aim to address this issue by leveraging AI and Big Data technologies. 
In this section, we will explain the key indicators used in our analysis and discuss the strategies that can be applied through the Telegram bot.

# Key Indicators
## Price
Price is the most fundamental indicator, and we process it to create various indices. Key examples include Rate of Change (ROC), Moving Average (MA), 
Bollinger Bands, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Relative Strength Index (RSI). 
These indices help identify trends, momentum, and potential market reversals, forming the foundation for effective quant strategies.

## Market Capitalization
Market capitalization is a key indicator that represents the total value of an asset, calculated as the product of circulating supply and current price. 
In quant strategies, assets are classified into large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap categories to establish investment strategies.
### Large Cap
Large-cap assets often have strong performance, significant interest in the cryptocurrency market, solid financial structures, and high credibility 
(e.g., backed by prominent VCs). They exhibit relatively low volatility, making them suitable for long-term investment approaches.
### Mid Cap
Mid-cap assets have a moderate level of market capitalization. Investors holding these assets can expect both growth potential and stability.
 Mid-caps also have higher liquidity compared to small-caps, resulting in lower transaction costs and reduced susceptibility to market shocks. 
 Unlike large-caps or small-caps, they tend to receive less attention from investors, creating opportunities for stable investment returns.
### Small Cap
Small-cap assets have low market capitalization. They possess high growth potential but are often in the early stages of development, 
with lower prices and less market attention. While they offer high potential returns due to their early growth phase, they also come with significant risks, 
such as low liquidity and increased vulnerability to market volatility. Additionally, small-caps are harder to research compared to large-caps and mid-caps. 
However, by diversifying investments in small-caps, it is possible to achieve high returns.

## Volume
Trading volume is an indicator that measures the liquidity of an asset in the market. In quant strategies, trading volume is used to assess the level of interest in an asset, market trends, and short-term supply and demand dynamics.
    
High trading volume indicates that the asset is attracting significant attention from investors. When trading volume increases, price volatility tends to rise, creating greater opportunities for high returns.  
  
Low trading volume represents assets that receive less market attention. If an asset with low trading volume is purchased before it gains market interest, it may offer high investment returns when its volatility increases.  


# Quant Strategy
## AI Quant Strategy
HypurrQuant utilizes deep learning-based prediction models. Unlike traditional financial markets, 
the cryptocurrency market lacks sufficient financial indicators, making it challenging to apply conventional quant strategies. 
Through deep learning-based prediction models, we forecast prices for the next 1, 3, 5, and 7 days. Based on these predictions, 
we provide users with information about assets that have a high likelihood of price increases. When integrated with traditional quant strategies, 
this approach can lead to higher investment returns.
  
## RealTime Quant Strategy
The RealTime Quant strategy relies on current market data rather than historical data, making it one of the most fundamental quant strategies. 
It allows for the use of all key indicators or a selected subset to tailor the approach. By holding a broader range of assets, 
it reduces risk while enhancing diversification. Below are detailed strategies that can be applied within this framework:

### Large Cap Strategy
- Description: Focuses on selecting assets with high market capitalization that exhibit stability and low volatility.
- Objective: Helps identify assets suitable for long-term investments due to their reliability and lower risk.
### Mid Cap Strategy
- Description: Targets assets with moderate market capitalization, balancing stability and growth potential.
- Objective: Aims to achieve steady returns while benefiting from the potential upside of mid-cap assets.
### Small Cap Strategy
- Description: Seeks out assets with high growth potential but higher risk and volatility.
- Objective: Pursues high returns by investing in early-stage or undervalued assets.
- Risk Management: Requires diversification and asset allocation to mitigate risks.
### High Volume Strategy
- Description: Identifies assets with surging trading volume, indicating increased market interest.
- Objective: Captures short-term momentum and price action driven by heightened activity.
### Low Volume Strategy
- Description: Focuses on assets with low trading volume, which are often undervalued or overlooked by the market.
- Objective: Identifies long-term growth opportunities by investing before these assets gain market attention.
### High Rate of Change Strategy
- Description: Enters assets with strong price momentum and rapid increases over short periods.
- Objective: Pursues high returns through short-term momentum-driven trades.
### Low Rate of Change Strategy
- Description: Selects assets in oversold conditions with a high likelihood of recovery.
- Objective: Targets undervalued assets with strong fundamentals to capitalize on rebound opportunities.


### Integrated Strategy Approach
These strategies are filtered using real-time market data for optimal execution. Combining multiple strategies typically yields better results than relying on a single approach. Examples include:
1. Large Cap + Low Rate of Change Strategy: Selecting large-cap assets in oversold conditions for long-term stability and potential recovery.
2.  Mid Cap + Low Volume Strategy: Investing in mid-cap assets with low trading volume, holding until the price appreciates as market interest grows.


## LongTerm Quant Strategy
- LongTerm strategies are backtested using 1D candles and are designed to generate consistent returns in the cryptocurrency market. Each strategy can be used independently or combined with others for enhanced results. HypurrQuant continuously updates its quant strategies to adapt to market dynamics. Below are the detailed strategies:
### Momentum Strategy

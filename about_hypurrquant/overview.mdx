## About HypurrQuant Team

The HypurrQuant team powers the HypurrQuant Bot - an automated trading bot built on Hyperliquid.
HypurrQuant Bot offers low-level utilities such as DCA, copy trading, grid trading, and rebalancing, as well as high-level auto-trading tools including a delta neutral strategy and AI-driven grid trading.

In addition, we will provide an automated position management service on HyperEVM that maximizes DEX LP yields.

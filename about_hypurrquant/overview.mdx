## About HypurrQuant Team

### Team History

Our team previously developed arbitrage programs between Korean and global exchanges, as well as CeFi yield farming systems that aimed to generate interest income on centralized platforms. However, we always felt limited by the nature of centralized systems — lacking transparency and full user control over assets.

Eventually, we discovered various Layer 2 DeFi ecosystems such as Mantle and Base, which led us to Hyperliquid, a PerpDex (perpetual decentralized exchange). As a beginner in trading at the time, I lost most of the assets I had earned through DeFi by engaging in leveraged trading on Hyperliquid.

This experience taught me a hard but valuable lesson: protecting your assets is even more important than simply making money. From that point on, my philosophy shifted from focusing on trading performance to building a sustainable and defensive strategy for growing assets — what I now call an "asset growth philosophy."

Our team is now guided by the following three core principles:

1. Risk Minimization  
We prioritize stability and predictability over high-risk, high-reward strategies like aggressive leverage. The first step to growing wealth is not losing it, and surviving long-term requires disciplined risk management.

2. Asset Preservation  
Even a profitable strategy can become meaningless if the asset’s volatility is too high or unpredictable. We focus on preserving capital while maintaining flexibility and liquidity.

3. Airdrop Farming & Low-Risk DeFi Participation  
Our main focus is on growing assets through low-risk, high-efficiency methods — such as participating in airdrops on blue-chip chains, staking in secure protocols, and contributing early to promising ecosystems.
Rather than chasing short-term price movements, we believe in diversifying time and capital for sustainable long-term growth.

If you share this mindset, why not join us in the opportunity-rich environment of HyperEVM — and grow your assets while hunting for the next big airdrops together?

title: "Automated Position Manager"
description: "The Automated Position Manager is a tool that helps users manage their LP positions more effectively."
---
<Note> Currently, when using Auto LP Manager, you will be swapped to Hyperbloom and receive a special HypurrQuant point boost.</Note>

### Supported Protocols
- DEXs: [Hybra](https://x.com/HybraFinance), [PRJX](https://x.com/prjx_hl), [HyperSwap](https://x.com/HyperSwapX), [Gliquid](https://x.com/gliquidx), [KittenSwap](https://x.com/KittenswapHype)(Soon)
- DEX Aggregators: [Hyperbloom](https://x.com/hyperbloomxyz), [LiquidSwap](https://x.com/LiquidLaunchHL)



## How It Works

Users can utilize the Auto LP Manager feature in the HypurrQuant Bot.
First, select the DEX where the pool will be automatically created and managed, then choose the desired pool and price range.  

To use the automated management feature, users can deposit any asset from the pool’s pair — either one asset or both.
Gas fees must be paid in HYPE tokens, which are different from wHYPE.

## Fee structure

There is no fee for minting a position, regardless of which DEX you choose.

Currently, a 0.1% fee is applied when performing swaps through the DEX aggregator. Swaps are only executed when adjusting the token ratio for a position.
Other than that, there are no additional fees.
